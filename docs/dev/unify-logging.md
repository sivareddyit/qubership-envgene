# Unified Logging

This document describes the logging improvements in issue: <https://github.com/Netcracker/qubership-envgene/issues/821>

## Problem Statement

**Previously:**

- Logging logic was duplicated across files
- Log formatting made logs unreadable
- Different colours for the same log level across jobs
- No log level control on Instance Project

**Now:**

- Logging is centralized
- Output is more readable and consistent
- Colour is consistent across jobs
- Input pipeline parameters logged on each job
- Log level can be set on Instance Project

---

## Key Changes

### 1. Centralized Logging

A single logging module was introduced.
All other modules import and use it.

**Benefits:**

- No duplicated logging logic
- Easier maintenance
- Consistent format across the repository
- Usage of one logging library (`import logging`)

### 2. New Logging Parameter

A new parameter was added to control logging behavior.

### 3. Coloured Log Levels

Different log levels now have consistent colours across jobs:

| Level          | Colour |
|----------------|--------|
| DEBUG          | Blue   |
| INFO (default) | White  |
| WARNING        | Yellow |
| ERROR          | Red    |

---

### 4. Parameter Logging Script for Generated Jobs

A script was added that:

- Runs at the start of every generated job
- Logs input parameters
